#### v2.0.0 (July 3, 2017)
* **Breaking Change:**  Updated the `ProxyConfig` & `UrlMatchPattern` to support multiple protocols.
* `ProxyConfig` and `ProxyConfigList` now accept the `host` and `port` keys instead of `server`. The `match` property also takes in multiple protocols:
```js
// v1.2.9
var proxyConfig = new ProxyConfig({
    match: 'http://*/foo',
    server: 'https://proxy.com:8080', // This has been split into host and port in v2.0.0
    tunnel: true
});
var proxyConfigList = new ProxyConfigList({}, [
    {
        match: 'http://*/foo',
        server: 'https://proxy.com:8080', // This has been split into host and port in v2.0.0
        tunnel: true
    }
]);

// v2.0.0
var proxyConfig = new ProxyConfig({
    match: 'http+ftp://*/foo', // match now supports multiple plus(`+`) separated protocols
    host: 'proxy.com', // In v1.2.9, `host` and `port` were combined into `server`
    port: 8080,
    tunnel: true
});

var ProxyConfigList = new ProxyConfigList({}, [
    {
        match: 'http+ftp://*/foo', // `match` now supports multiple plus(`+`) separated protocols
        host: 'proxy.com', // In v1.2.9, `host` and `port` were combined into `server`
        port: 8080,
        tunnel: true
    }
]);
```
* `UrlMatchPattern` now returns an array of protocol strings:
```js
// v1.2.9
var matchPattern = new UrlMatchPattern('http://*/*').createMatchPattern();
matchPattern.protocol // 'http'

// v2.0.0
var matchPattern = new UrlMatchPattern('http://*/*').createMatchPattern();
matchPattern.protocols // ['http'] (The singular protocol key has been replaced with the plural protocols in v2.0.0)

var anotherMatchPattern = new UrlMatchPattern('http+https+ftp+file://').createMatchPattern();
anotherMatchPatter.protocols // ['http', 'https', 'ftp', 'file']
```
* `ProxyConfig#server` has been removed in favour of the new host format:
```js
// v1.2.9
var proxyConfigList = new ProxyConfigList({}, [
    {
        match: 'https://*/*',
        host: 'proxy.com'
    }
]);
proxyConfigList.resolve('https://www.google.com').server.getHost(); // `proxy.com`

// v2.0.0
var proxyConfigList = new ProxyConfigList({}, [
    {
        match: 'https://*/*',
        host: 'proxy.com'
    }
]);
proxyConfigList.resolve('https://www.google.com').host // `proxy.com`
```

(One caveat is that this now uses `_postman_propertyName` to detect VariableList and a note has been added to ensure that this is not changed)
